This report aims to explore the use of ML techniques in predicting maternal mortality risk by:
Conducting exploratory data analysis of variables contributing to maternal mortality.
Experiment with Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistics Regression, and Support Vector Machine algorithms to predict maternal mortality risk.
Evaluating and comparing the performance of each algorithm and identifying the most effective algorithm for predicting maternal mortality risk.
Discussing the limitations and challenges of using ML in maternal health and provide recommendations for future research.
